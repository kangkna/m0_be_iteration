# Self Evaluation

- How confident do you feel in your understanding and fluency with the `each` method?
I feel confident when doing the simple exercises but when it comes to challenging ones I am not too confident
- This was a much more advanced concept than anything you've done in Mod 0, and the exercises required you to push yourself to apply other background knowledge or learn things outside of the curriculum - how did that feel? Did you have productive struggle? Unproductive struggle?
In this exercise it took me less time than I had anticipated, a lot of my peers had asked the questions that I had in the exercise and this really saved a lot of my time. For example I knew I had to use the if function but I didn't know if I use it with each function I need to end twice. Overall I feel pretty good about it and thoroughly enjoyed the challenges.
- What do you still need to practice or learn? How will you do that? Do you need to adjust your calendar in order to do that?
I still need to practice the each function and if function. I will probably do it this weekend.
- What questions do you still have? How will you get the answers you need?
I don't have any questions right now and I found Slack really helpful just looking at what other people had asked.
